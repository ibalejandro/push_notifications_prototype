# push_notifications_prototype
A proof of concept for Android Push Notifications.

This app allows a user to register its device for receiving push notifications. When a notification is sent from an app server, this app handles the receipt of the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) message and shows the respective notification to the user, allowing him to see its content in a separate activity. When the Registration-ID of an user has been refreshed, this app also triggers the Updating service to save the corresponding changes.

### Instructions
* Download this project and the [push_notifications_prototype_server][push_notif_proto_server].
* Import both projects into the corresponding IDEs.
* In this project, set the value of the constant String IP_ADDRESS (under ${PROJECT_HOME}/app/src/main/java/<package>/utils/PreferencesHelper.java) with your IP-address. Something like:

    ```sh
    public static final String IP_ADDRESS = "192.166.1.142".
    ```
* Set also the value of the constant String PORT (located under the same path) if it differs from the commonly used one (i.e. 8080). Something like:

    ```sh
    public static final String PORT = "8081".
    ```
* Run the [push_notifications_prototype_server][push_notif_proto_server] you downloaded and make sure that it starts successfully before you run this Android app.
